            Porcha is an awesome career coach! In addition to staying deeply knowledgeable about the job market and best practices, she has an incredible knack for helping candidates zero in on their priorities and create actionable plans to move forward purposefully in the job search. I personally loved the way she asked me great questions throughout my job search that helped me better communicate with and make decisions about my prospective employers. I highly recommend her as a great job search advocate!

          I’ve had the pleasure of working with Porcha after finishing my General Assembly 12-week UX immersive course. I was impressed by her ability to jump straight into coaching us and continuously refining her delivery, material, and tips to cater to our industry throughout the 12-week duration and then throughout my job search. Her receptiveness to industry-relevant feedback complimented her deep knowledge of job searching, interview prepping, and storytelling. Finding my perfect job took 7-8 weeks from portfolio launch to accepting a job offer and I know all of this combined with Porcha’s upbeat attitude played a large role in my success. Definitely would recommend Porcha, thank you for all your help!

        Throughout my transition into tech, Porcha was there diligently providing me with the resources and mentorship I needed to be properly positioned for the jobs I applied to. Her feedback during our mock interview sessions helped me confidently navigate the interview process in a new career and industry. Her positivity definitely helped as well, especially during weeks where I felt exhausted by the job search process. She’s great at what she does and I’m happy I got to work with her.

        I was a student at General Assembly and Porcha was my career coach. She was terrific! She's communicative, reliable, and resourceful. On top of all of that, she's very kind and easy to speak to. She held me accountable when I was transitioning to a new position as a UX Researcher. I appreciate her help very much.

        I cannot thank Ms. Porcha enough for her help as I transitioned into the tech world! Because of her coaching, I was offered (and accepted) an incredible job just one month after my UX bootcamp. She taught me how to brand myself and she instilled in me the confidence I needed to land a job I never imagined I could get. Because of Ms. Porcha, I am now prepared to walk into any interview and negotiation. I truly believe I am where I am today because of the coaching and industry knowledge I received from Ms. Porcha. I cannot give a higher recommendation!

        Porcha is a fantastic career services leader with expertise in both student coaching and employer engagement. I had the opportunity to participate in an "Employer Speaks" event that Porcha both planned and executed. Her poise and leadership skills resulted in a well attended event and meaningful discussion with prospective students, alumni and employer partners alike. Porcha also embraces a tech enabled approach to career services and was a champion for the Gurnick EDGE platform during her tenure there.
